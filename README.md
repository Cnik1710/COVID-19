# COVID-19 Data Analysis Case Study

## Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, leading to significant health, economic, and social consequences. This case study aims to analyze COVID-19 data to extract meaningful insights regarding the virus's spread, mortality, and recovery rates. By leveraging Python for data analysis, this project will help in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and its impact across different regions.

## Dataset Details
This case study utilizes three key datasets that provide daily updates on different aspects of the pandemic across various countries and regions:

- Confirmed Cases Dataset: Contains cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases per day for each country and region. The data spans from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021, covering over 276 geographic entries.
- Deaths Dataset: Records the cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, structured similarly to the confirmed cases dataset. This dataset helps assess the outbreak's severity and lethality in different regions.
- Recovered Cases Dataset: Includes data on cumulative recoveries, which is crucial for understanding disease progression and treatment effectiveness.

Each dataset consists of the following columns:
- Province/State: The specific region within a country (if applicable).
- Country/Region: The country or region for which data is recorded.
- Latitude & Longitude: Geographic coordinates.
- Date Columns: Cumulative totals for confirmed cases, deaths, or recoveries recorded daily.

## Analysis Questions
 1. Data Loading
- How do you load the COVID-19 datasets for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries into Python using Pandas?

 2. Data Exploration
- What is the structure of each dataset in terms of rows, columns, and data types?
- Generate plots of confirmed cases over time for top affected countries.
- Generate a plot of confirmed cases over time for China.

 3. Handling Missing Data
- Identify missing values and replace them using appropriate techniques.
- Replace blank values in the Province column with "All Provinces."

 4. Independent Dataset Analysis
- Analyze the peak number of daily new cases in Germany, France, and Italy. Which country experienced the highest single-day surge, and when did it occur?
- Compare the recovery rates (recoveries/confirmed cases) between Canada and Australia as of December 31, 2020. Which country had a better management strategy based on this metric?
- Examine the distribution of death rates (deaths/confirmed cases) among provinces in Canada. Identify the province with the highest and lowest death rates based on the latest data.

 5. Data Transformation
- Convert the "Deaths" dataset from wide format (columns as dates) to long format (each row representing a single date, with country names and death counts).
- Calculate the total number of deaths per country up to the latest available date.
- Identify the top five countries with the highest average daily deaths.

 6. Data Merging
- Merge the transformed datasets (confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries) on 'Country/Region' and 'Date' to create a comprehensive view of the pandemicâ€™s impact.
- Analyze the monthly sum of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for all countries.
- Repeat the above analysis specifically for the United States, Italy, and Brazil.

 7. Combined Data Analysis
- Identify the three countries with the highest average death rates (deaths/confirmed cases) throughout 2020. What might this indicate about the pandemic's impact in these countries?
- Compare the total number of recoveries to the total number of deaths in South Africa. What does this reveal about COVID-19 outcomes in the country?
- Analyze the recovery-to-confirmed cases ratio for the United States on a monthly basis from March 2020 to May 2021. Which month had the highest recovery ratio, and what could be the contributing factors?
